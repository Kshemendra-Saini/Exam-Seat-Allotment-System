# Exam-Seat-Allotment-System
It is a webApp used to allocate seat to students during university exams.
At first, an admin will give access to faculties to upload the student details.
Admin will also upload the exam time table and also a list of faculties to be appointed as proctors.
The system will then assign faculty as a supervisor to every room 
and will also allocate seats to the students in different rooms.
